# Data Description

This dataset is a cleaned and modified version of the [Panic Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaychoudhary/panic-attack-dataset). 

The dataset includes missing values in  categorical columns. The following preprocessing steps have been applied to handle the missing data and prepare the dataset for analysis:

### Preprocessing Steps

#### Categorical Columns:
- Missing values in categorical columns are imputed with a constant value, **""Missing""**. This imputation strategy helps retain the potential informative value of the missingness, which can be useful in certain machine learning models.

#### Encoding:
- **Label Encoding** is applied to all categorical columns, converting them into numeric values suitable for machine learning models.
- **OneHotEncoding** is applied to all categorical columns, converting them into numeric values suitable for machine learning models.

### Data Files:
- **LabelEnocded Data**: A CSV file containing data preprocessed and Label Encoded Ready to train **MODEL**.
- **OneHotEncoded Data**: A CSV file containing data preprocessed and OneHot Encoded Ready to train **MODEL**.
- **Additional Features Data**: A CSV file containing data preprocessed and Some other Usefull **New Features** Encoded  and Ready to train **MODEL**.

### **Feature Descriptions**

| Column Name                | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Heart_Rate_Category**    | Categorizes heart rate into 'Low' (<100 bpm), 'Normal' (100-120 bpm), and 'High' (>120 bpm). |
| **Panic_Attack_Severity**  | Measures the severity of a panic attack as the product of `Panic_Attack_Frequency` and `Duration_Minutes`. |
| **Symptom_Count**          | The total number of panic attack symptoms (`Sweating`, `Shortness_of_Breath`, `Dizziness`, `Chest_Pain`, `Trembling`) experienced by the individual. |
| **Caffeine_Impact**        | A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) showing whether caffeine was the trigger and the individual consumes caffeine. |
| **Exercise_vs_Stress**     | A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) showing if the trigger was stress and the individual exercises more than twice per week. |
| **Medication_Dependency**  | A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) showing if the individual takes medication and has a panic attack frequency greater than 6. |
| **Age_Group**              | Categorizes age into 'Young' (â‰¤25), 'Adult' (26-45), 'Middle-aged' (46-65), and 'Senior' (>65). |
| **Gender_Binary**          | Encodes gender as `0` for Male, `1` for Female, and `2` for Non-binary/Other. |
| **History_of_Mental_Illness** | A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) showing whether the individual has a history of `Anxiety`, `Depression`, or `PTSD`. |
| **High_Risk_Individual**   | A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) showing if an individual sleeps <5 hours, consumes caffeine >3 times, and has a history of mental illness. |
